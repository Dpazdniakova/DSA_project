# DSA Project

This is a copy of my Github Classroom repo project for data structures and algorithms. A simple desktop application built in Kotlin that visualizes key data structures and their behaviors using Jetpack Compose.

## Features

The application includes visualizations for the following data structures:

- **Linked List** – view insertion, deletion, traversal, and updates
- **Stack** – demonstrate push, pop, and stack properties
- **Queue** – visualize enqueue and dequeue operations
- **Binary Tree** – show tree traversal and node relationships

## Technologies

- **Kotlin** – primary programming language
- **Jetpack Compose for Desktop** – UI framework for composing interactive visual components
- **Gradle** – build automation and dependency management
